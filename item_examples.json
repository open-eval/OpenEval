What are the first four terms of the sequence?\n**2, 7, 12, 17**\n*(Reasoning: This is the only option listed that represents an arithmetic sequence, adding 5 each time.)*\n\n**Question at position 3**\nScreenshot 2023-08-05 at 1.26.18 PM.png\n**Cannot be answered (Missing Image)**\n*(Reasoning: The question requires the graph from the screenshot to determine the correct equation.)*\n\n**Question at position 4**\nWhich function passses through the points shown in the table below?\nX 0 1 2 3\nY 1,000 500 250 125\n**$y = 1000(0.5)^x$**\n*(Reasoning: The y-value halves every step, meaning the base is 0.5 and the starting value is 1,000.)*\n\n**Question at position 5**\nA geometric sequence is shown below. 3, 15, 75, 375, . . . Which explicit formula can be used to determine the nth term of the sequence?\n**$a_n = 3(5)^{n-1}$**\n*(Reasoning: The first term is 3 and the common ratio is 5.)*\n\n**Question at position 6**\nAn arithmetic sequence is shown below. 5, 1, -3, -7, . . . Which explicit formula can be used to determine the nth term of the sequence?\n**$f(n) = -4n + 9$**\n*(Reasoning: The sequence decreases by 4 each time. Using $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, we get $5 + (n-1)(-4) = -4n + 9$.)*\n\n**Question at position 7**\nAn arithmetic sequence is defined by: f(1)= -8. What is the 7th term of the sequence?\n**Cannot be determined from text provided**\n*(Reasoning: The rule for the sequence (the common difference) was missing from the text. However, if the common difference was 4, the answer is 16. If the difference was -6, the answer is -44.)*\n\n**Question at position 8**\nKevin is saving money for a trip. He has $150 and plans to save $48 each month. Which recursive equation represents the amount of money kevin has saved after n months?\n**$f(n) = f(n-1) + 48$**\n*(Reasoning: Recursive equations take the previous amount and add the change.)*\n\n**Question at position 9**\nScreenshot 2023-08-05 at 1.00.59 PM.png\n**Cannot be answered (Missing Image)**\n\n**Question at position 10**\nA sequence is defined by the equation where f(1)=6 and [Missing Rule]. What is the fifth term in the sequence?\n**96**\n*(Reasoning: While the rule is missing from your text, the options suggest a geometric sequence where the number doubles each time ($r=2$). 6, 12, 24, 48, 96.)*\n\n**Question at position 11**\nMiesha is saving the same amount of money each week. After 2 weeks, she saves $85. After 4 weeks, she saves $135. Which equation models the amount of money Miesha will have saved, y, after x weeks?\n**$y = 25x + 35$**\n*(Reasoning: The slope is $(135-85)/(4-2) = 25$. Using point-slope form: $y - 85 = 25(x-2) \\rightarrow y = 25x + 35$.)*\n\n**Question at position 12**\nScreenshot 2023-08-05 at 1.20.57 PM.png\n**Cannot be answered (Missing Image)**\n\n**Question at position 13**\nThe function below describes an arithmetic sequence. Where f(n) is the nth term and n is the term number. Which table best fits the sequence?\n**n: 1, 2, 3, 4 | f(n): 9, 12, 15, 18**\n*(Reasoning: This is the only table option that shows a valid arithmetic sequence (adding 3 each time) starting with standard integer term numbers.)*\n\n**Question at position 14**\nA geometric sequence is shown below. 24, 12, 6, . . . Which is the explicit formula for this sequence?\n**$a_n = 24(1/2)^{n-1}$**\n*(Reasoning: The sequence starts at 24 and is cut in half each time.)*\n\n**Question at position 15**\nThe sequence below shows the number of raffle tickets that Samantha sold each day during a month. 3, 7, 11, 15, . . . Which explicit formula models the number of tickets Samantha sold on day x?\n**$f(x) = 4x - 1$**\n*(Reasoning: The sequence increases by 4. $3 + (x-1)4 = 4x - 1$.)*\n\n**Question at position 16**\nThe table below shows the amount of bacteria in a lab dish after different amounts of time. (1, 150), (2, 450), (3, 1350)... Which function models the population of bacteria?\n**$y = 50(3)^x$**\n*(Reasoning: The bacteria triples every hour ($450/150 = 3$). The starting value at time 0 would be 50. Note: The multiple choice options provided in your text were linear equations, which are incorrect for this data.)*\n\n**Question at position 17**\nAn geometric sequence is defined by: f(1)= 4. What is the 7th term of the sequence?\n**1/16**\n*(Reasoning: Although the ratio was missing from the text, 1/16 is the only answer that fits a standard geometric pattern with an integer base (ratio of 1/2). $4 \\cdot (0.5)^6 = 0.0625$ or $1/16$.)*\n\n**Question at position 18**\nScreenshot 2023-08-05 at 1.03.33 PM.png\n**Cannot be answered (Missing Image)**\n\n**Question at position 19**\nThe 12th term of an arithmetic sequence is 87 and the 20th term is 135. Which number represents the value of the common difference, d, of the sequence?\n**6**\n*(Reasoning: $135 - 87 = 48$. The difference in terms is $20 - 12 = 8$. $48 / 8 = 6$.)*\n\n**Question at position 20**\nWhich function models the data in the table below? (-1, 200), (0, 100), (1, 50), (2, 25)\n**$F(x) = 100(0.5)^x$**\n*(Reasoning: The y-intercept (at 0) is 100, and the values are cut in half for every increase in x.)*",
